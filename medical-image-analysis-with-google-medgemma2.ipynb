    "## 🎯 Abstract\n",
    "Healthcare systems worldwide face escalating clinician burnout, widening health literacy gaps, and limited access to specialist care in resource-constrained settings. Physicians spend over half their time on documentation, patients often struggle to understand medical guidance, and rural clinics lack advanced diagnostic support.\n",
