# 🏥 Analyzing Medical Images with Google MedGemma 1.5
---
## 🎯 Abstract
Healthcare systems worldwide face escalating clinician burnout, widening health literacy gaps, and limited access to specialist care in resource-constrained settings. Physicians spend over half their time on documentation, patients often struggle to understand medical guidance, and rural clinics lack advanced diagnostic support.

This notebook demonstrates **Google's MedGemma 1.5** model for analyzing medical images including X-rays, CT scans, and ultrasounds.
